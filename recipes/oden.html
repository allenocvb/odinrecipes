        <p> In life, Oden,the daimyo of Kuri in Wano Country, is one of the strongest characters in the One Piece world and wields two legendary swords: Ame no Habakiri and Enma.
            Named after the favorite food, Oden, the daimyo declared he was born to be boiled like oden soup. 
            Oden is a type of hot pot dish, consisting of several ingredients such as boiled eggs, daikon, konjac, and processed fishcakes stewed in a light, soy-flavored dashi broth.
