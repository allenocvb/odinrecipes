            <li>Marinate your beef in the ginger, garlic, turmeric and yogurt 
                (Marinating overnight will allow the meat to become more tender and flavorful when you cook it).</li>
            <li>Slice carrots and tomatoes, cube potatoes and grate apples.</li>
            <li>Chop onions and then sweat them on a high heat until they are soft. 
                Reduce heat and brown, once browned set aside.</li>
            <li>Put butter in a pot and heat until its melted. Add the flour and cook it a little on a low heat. 
                Add your curry powder and garam masala then keep stirring until it becomes very fragrant.</li>
            <li>Slowly add stock while stirring.</li>
            <li>Add your browned onions, carrot, potato, tomato and grated apple.</li>
            <li>Bring mixture to a boil and then turn down to simmer. Place a lid on top (Stir often so it doesnt burn).</li>
            <li>Cook your rice before your curry is done so you can plate it all while its hot.</li>
            <li>After about 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours it should be done? Idk what your stove is like.</li>
            <li>Enjoy a taste of the East Blue!</li>
